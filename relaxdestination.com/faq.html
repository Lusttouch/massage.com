                    		Why do you require a credit card to hold an appointment? Will it be charged in advance of the appointment or can I pay some other way after the massage?

                    	<br />
                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> We require a valid credit card to hold all appointments but we do not charge your card in advance. On the day of your appointment, you can either ask us to put the charge through on the card on file or provide alternate payment in the form of cash, check, different credit card or gift certificate. If you do not show up for your appointment or cancel with less than 24-hours then we will charge the appointment fee to the card on file.

                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> We do require a valid credit card to book an appointment using our online system. If you would prefer to use your gift certificate number in lieu of your credit card to hold the appointment, you may do so. Per our cancellation policy, if you do not show up for your appointment or cancel with less than 24-hours notice, you will forfeit your gift certificate instead of being charged in full for the session. It also means that, if you'd like to use our online booking system in the future, you would need to provide a valid credit card in order to use the system going forward.

                    	<br />
                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> Our policy is to charge the full appointment fee in the event that an appointment is missed or cancelled with less than 24-hours notice. We understand that it may feel frustrating to pay for a service you donâ€™t receive however, this is a way for us to protect our therapists and be sure they are getting paid for their time. Simply put, if someone misses an appointment without notice, it prevents that therapist from working during the reserved time. In some cases that can represent up to 1/3 of the therapist's earnings for a day. Thank you for your understanding!

                    	<br />
                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> Yes. If you feel like your massage was exceptional and you would like to tip above the price of the session you are welcome to do this, however, it is not necessary. We have priced our services at a fair market rate for our area so please don't feel like you have to tip especially if it would be a burden to do so in any way.

                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> Yes, as long as we have a massage therapist available you may do so.

                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> Unless your therapist directs you otherwise, you are invited to undress to the level of your comfort during your massage.  Many people remove all but underclothes or some people undress completely. Regardless of how much clothing you elect to leave on, we ask you to start your session completely covered by the sheets and blankets provided. Your therapist will then uncover each area of your body as they work on it, working to maintain your privacy and comfort as they go.

                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> We require payment at the time of service and do not accept any form of insurance nor are we able to bill third parties for your appointments. We are happy to provide you with receipts for your payments to us, which you may submit directly to your insurance company for reimbursement if that option is available to you.

                    	<i class="far fa-hand-point-right text-pink"></i> Generally, we will be in touch the day prior to the expected bad weather to make arrangements for the next day and to notify you. If we feel it might be unsafe for our therapist to come to the appointment, we will contact you in advance to reschedule.
